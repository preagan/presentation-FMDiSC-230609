Artillery

- quick way to obtain an FMS token

1. in an FM file script step, set a variable to a Base64 value...
   Set Variable >> $temp >> Base64EncodeRFC ( 3548 ; "username:password" )
   ...then have the script pause so you can use the Data Viewer to copy the resulting string
   ...run the script, copy the string and use it in the next step
2. open a Terminal window and run this curl command...
   $ curl -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Basic <your Base64 string>'
   -X POST -d '{}' <path to your hosted file>
   Note: it looks like JavaScript can be used in your Artillery .yml config file to automatically do these two steps, but that was beyond the scope of this presentation
